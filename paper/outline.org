* Goal: Design an alternative drum interface with the following characteristics
  - Has a "near" 1-1 mapping from interface to a real drum (i.e. its gonna be a circular pad of some sort)
  - Should be quiet because:
     - It shouldn't be the device creating noise (could leak into other near by instrumentation)
     - Roommates don't appreciate 3am drum sessions
  - Should be able to operate using relatively low cost parts

* Technique for acquiring data
  - Attach foam damping to drum pad and sense using Piezo Electric contact mics.
  - From calibration phase (discuss multiple techniques) generate candidate functions from signal to forcing
      - Physics inspired approach of estimating the the parameters to the green's function (lots of charts and data to go along with it)
      - Machine Learning approach of using markov chains to generate forcing from response (have yet to get this to actually work)
  - Advantages:
       - Damping succeeds in significantly lowering the sound produced by filtering out high frequencies
       - In addition, damping makes the time constant smaller making echos negligible (kind-of).
       - Finally, an unintentional consequence of having the waves travel through the foam, is that the wave speed is significantly slower
           - This means that you can use much lower sampling rates (and cheaper sensors) to do TDOA
   - Disadvantages:
       - Unclear what the non-linear affects are and how they are effecting the forcing computed
           - Because I am not synthesizing right now, its hard to tell if the responses are at all reasonable
       - Will likely still need fast computers to do synthesis and calibration
       - Trying to estimate greens function introduces lag
       - Sampling at a slower rate introduces lag

* Future Work
   - Try to use a sensor that does not require direct interaction with the foam such as a magnet placed under the drum head (or threaded into the drum head)
       - This may allow one to ignore some of the weirder effects of the signal traveling through the foam, while still benefiting from damping
       - In addition, this mitigates issues of the sound wave traveling through the drum enclosure (which has a large wave speed) to the sensor
    - Attempt to do synthesis with the data produced by this technique
    - Explore the foam dynamics more and investigate other dampening schemes that behave more linearly (ideally more constrained to 2-d)
